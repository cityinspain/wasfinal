# wasfinal

Check the final score of an MLB game, without spoilers.

## Inspiration

I was watching the Mariners game from the night before, and when they were down by 6 in the bottom of the 7th, 
I threw this script together to check to see if they'd end up scoring any more runs that game.

They didn't. :(

## Usage

`python3 wasfinal.py`

## To Do

- [ ] add option to check if a certain team's score changes, rather than either team
- [ ] improve interface
